# PyBer_Analysis

## Background
The purpose of this analysis was to go through ride sharing data and determine metrics that will allow V. Isualize to compare rural, suburban, and urban cities' rides. This included total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as average fares per ride and per driver, organized to different tables.
## Deliverable Analysis
There are several significant observations to be made while looking at the data when sorted by city type
As cities became more urban several trends emerged: -Total rides, total fares, and total drivers all increased, likely due to the higher population -Average fare per ride and average fare per driver all decreased

## Conclusion
The data may be used to consider the following:

* Such a vast difference in avg fare per driver may pull drivers out to the suburbs/rural areas. Consider researching pay per mile and tweaking the pay structure if the pay per mile is significantly higher in less urban areas

* Consider increasing the fare in urban areas for more profit since almost 2/3 of rides are in urban areas

* Possibly incentivize hiring more suburban/rural drivers since the avg fare is so high. Whether this is due to high demand or longer rides or some other factor should be investigated. If rides are more profitable, then attaining more rural/suburban business should be a priority.
